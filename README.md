## 📖 Introduction

This repository presents Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), a technique designed to enhance the efficiency of fine-tuning in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. By leveraging various techniques, PEFT aims to reduce the computational requirements and memory footprint associated with traditional fine-tuning.

## 🎯 Traditional Fine-Tuning

Traditional fine-tuning in NLP involves training a pre-trained model on a task-specific dataset. While effective, it can be computationally expensive and resource-intensive. This section explores the concept of traditional fine-tuning and discusses its limitations.

## 🔧 Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning Techniques

This section introduces several techniques used in Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning:

### 3.1. 💡 Knowledge Distillation

Knowledge distillation involves transferring knowledge from a large pre-trained model (teacher) to a smaller model (student), making fine-tuning more efficient.

### 3.2. ✂️ Pruning

Pruning techniques focus on removing unnecessary weights or connections from a pre-trained model, reducing its size and improving fine-tuning efficiency.

### 3.3. ⚖️ Quantization

Quantization reduces the precision of numerical values in a model, typically from floating-point to fixed-point representation. It helps reduce the model size and memory requirements, improving fine-tuning efficiency.

### 3.4. 🧩 Low-Rank Factorization

Low-rank factorization approximates a high-dimensional weight matrix with low-rank matrices, reducing the number of parameters and computations needed during fine-tuning.

### 3.5. 🧠 Knowledge Injection

Knowledge injection involves incorporating additional information, such as linguistic or domain-specific knowledge, into the fine-tuning process. It guides the learning process, improving fine-tuning performance and efficiency.

### 3.6. 🛠️ Adapter Modules

Adapter modules are lightweight, task-specific modules that can be inserted into a pre-trained model without modifying its architecture. They enhance fine-tuning efficiency by enabling the reusability of pre-trained models across multiple tasks.

## 🌟 Advantages of Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning

This section highlights the advantages of Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques. By leveraging these techniques, fine-tuning processes become more efficient, reducing computational requirements, memory footprint, and training time.

## 💻 Code Sample: Efficient Fine-Tuning with PEFT
